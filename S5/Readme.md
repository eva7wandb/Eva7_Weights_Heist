# S5 - Coding Drill Down

In this session we go through many architectures starting from the very basic skeleton and try to achieve the goal of getting 99.4% accuracy on the MNIST dataset using under 10,000 parameters and 15 epochs.


# Round 0 

- get the code setup right.
- starting from the 8th iteration of class.
- not using any img aug, and lr steps now.
- the intention of this step is to have the correct code setup.
  expecting to see a test accuracy of 99.41 at 9th epoch, as that is what was achieved for the same run on class.
